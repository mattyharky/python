#This is a single line comment.
#The hash tag symbol is used to show the start of the comment.
#Any text to the right of the hash symbol is the comment.
#People use comments in code to inform the reader
#An example comment could be:
#Created by Matty Harkin 5th September 2019
"""
Any line that has three sets of double quote marks on it is the start
of a multi-line comment.
You can type in what ever you like and each line will be treated as a comment.
The multi-line comment ends when another set of three double quote marks are typed.

#A variable is a place in computer memory that can hold and remember information

#This example sends another string of text, it even includes numbers BUT it is treated as string
